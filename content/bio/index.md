I started my programming adventure while I worked in Controlling, where, as an analyst, I initially automated processes and analyses using Excel and VBA. As my tasks and the amount of data grew, I became   interested in other technologies. 

Thanks to a good friend of mine, I first heard about Python. At that time, he borrowed me a book called **"Python. Introduction"**. After reading it, I started writing my first scripts, mainly for extracting data from databases and for automating analyses. This book, even though I am already quite familiar with Python, has found its way permanently onto my bookshelf and reminds me of where I started my journey to where I am now. 

Wanting to learn about the new possibilities of Python, I ended up at a **Data Science** bootcamp where I gained a solid foundation, but it still wasn't enough for me. Looking for a further development path, but also to systematise the knowledge I had already gained, I continued my learning under the guidance of a porgramming mentor at Dev Mentoring.

I currently work as an Automation Developer, supporting operational teams in automating processes using **Python, VBA, TS**. Additionally, I support the team with **CI/CD** process using Docker and GitHub Actions
